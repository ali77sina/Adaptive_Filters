# Adaptive_Filters
Adaptive Filter Parameter Learning Using CNNs (for FIR filters) 

This proejct involves creating a synthetic dataset, creating snippets of different noisy sinosoids with different frequencies and setting a frequency band of interest, without telling your model! and seeing your CNN's filter's frequency response, showing how this can be used as an adaptive method to create filters

**Creating_Synthetic_Dataset**: creating the said synthetic dataset

**training**: training a CNN on a single band

**multiple_bands**: training on different bands to see the frequency response of these filters.
